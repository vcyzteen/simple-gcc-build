- Variable
Before running the building you have to research these variables in drone.io first
    
  • GH_TOKEN - Fill with github token
  • MARKER - Fill with your github username
  • REPONAME - Fill with your new template repo for gcc
  • TOOCHAIN_NAME - Fill with according to what you want
  • TOKEN_BOT - Fill with your telegram bot token

To push gcc into the github repo, just create one repo here because I have modified these scripts with 1 repo and different branches. like 64/32 this will be made in one repo but different branch

- Usage
Running this script is quite simple. We start by forking:

  • Fork this repo
  • Open your https://cloud.drone.io
  • Sync and connect the repo from fork
  • Goto settings repo and set variabel
  • Run new build for build automatic

As of now, I only support arm, arm64 and x86 (compiles for x86_64 only). This list is subject to change as I receive requests.

Keep in mind that this script contains just the bare minimum prerequisites.

  • Vaisakh for base this scripts.
  • OS Dev Wiki for knowledge base.
  • USBHost's Amazing GCC Build script for certain prerequisite dependencies.

- Looking for precompiled toolchains?
My GCC Cross Compiler builds are automated build faster. They are pushed to:

  • https://github.com/vcyzteen/gcc-arm64.git [ ARM64 ] stable branch
  • https://github.com/vcyzteen/gcc-arm.git [ ARM32 ] stable branch
